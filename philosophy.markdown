My daygame journey has had its share of ups and downs. Most importantly, daygame has taught me a lot about myself and the world, things I'm not sure I could've learned any other way.

Now convinced that daygame will be a lifelong pursuit, I am starting this journal to document the remainder of my journey. It is first and foremost for myself, to help me gather my thoughts on game and speak to myself.

I want to start by summarizing my seduction philosophy.

## Physically interact with at least one cute woman every day.

The physical interaction is 90% of the game. Everything else is 10%. Manage my attention accordingly. 

Don't over-attend to fashion, photos, looks, texting, etc. Focus primarily on the man to woman, face to face, interaction.

Do this **every day**. Consistency is much more powerful than volume.

## Trust the natural progress.

Trust myself to learn what works and what doesn't from my daily interactions with women.

Don't bother with shortcuts, tricks, or other people's experiences. Donâ€™t read, talk, or ask about game tactics.

Don't force a model prematurely, especially one based on other people's experiences, which can be very different.

Natural progress will take time. So have patience and make the daily interactions fun for myself. Since fucking is the highest level of fun, trust myself to move towards it naturally.

## Don't masturbate or watch porn.

Re-purpose that energy towards the women I am seducing.

---

## No matter what, remind myself everyday to be grateful that beautiful women exist.

Much of game is not in my control. Therefore, the game is **NOT** lost if the woman flakes or doesn't give her number or doesn't fuck. The game **IS** lost when my inner peace is lost, limiting my ability to express myself fully and honestly. 

Keep this inner peace in check by being grateful that women, as capricious as they may be, make everyday an adventure worth living.
