My daygame journey has had its share of ups and downs. Most importantly, it has taught me a lot about myself and the world, things I'm not sure I could've learned any other way.

Now convinced that daygame will be a lifelong pursuit, I want to chronicle the remainder of my journey. This journal is primarily for myself, to help organize  my thoughts on game.

I want to start by summarizing my present seduction philosophy.

## Game Daily

Physically interact with at least one new beautiful woman every day. Consistency is much more powerful than volume. Daily interactions also create a feeling of abundance.

Focus on the physical face-to-face interaction, which is 90% of the game. Everything else is 10%. 

Manage my attention accordingly. Don't over-attend to fashion, social media, looks, texting, etc.

## Trust Nature

Trust myself to learn what works and what doesn't from my daily interactions with women.

Don't bother with shortcuts, gimmicks, or other people's techniques. Don't read, talk, or invest energy in game literature or theory.

Don't place much weight on other people's experiences. Figure things out for myself.

Let natural progress take its course. Have patience and make the daily interactions fun and positive.

A consensual primal fuck is the highest level of fun. Trust that I'll figure out how to get there with time.

## No Porn

Re-purpose that energy and attention towards the women in real life.

## Be Grateful

Much of game is not in my control. Accept it. Embrace it. Don't force things.

The game is not lost if the woman flakes or doesn't give her number or doesn't fuck.

The game is lost when my inner peace is lost, limiting my ability to express myself fully and honestly.

Keep this inner peace in check. Remind myself everyday to be grateful that beautiful women exist to make life an adventure worth living.
