I got my Indian flag a few weeks ago - a lovely yoga teacher I met in Mysore, small peaceful city in the state of Karnataka, India.

I've been living in India since Oct 2018 and I've approached ~100 girls in India so far.

Below I share some of my notable memories and observations from seducing girls in India.

## Observations
It took some failures and awkward moments to realize that street approaching in India was not effective. Lot of loafers and beggars on the street. I was automatically lumped in with them and faced an uphill battle to redeem myself. And if I dressed too well, then I just got stares from every direction. The pollution, hot weather, and dust also made long sessions unsustainable. I had to unlearn all the street approaching I did in US cities. Malls were my savior. And after learning how to ride a motorcycle, I frequented malls regularly where I did most of my approaching. 

Some people say daygame in New York on London is the ultimate test in ability. I beg to differ. They both have something India does not ‚Äî volume. You can easily approach 10-15 girls a day in New York and probably never see them again. This allows you to fail repeatedly without major consequences. Any half decent guy is bound to get laid in those cities if he puts in a little effort. Even though India has 1.3 billion people, I found very few approachable daygame sets. The pandemic made it worse. Solo cute girl sets were rare as girls usually ventured out in groups. I considered it a good day if could manage one 7-10 minute interaction with a cute girl. This dearth of options sharpened my game however. I got better at dealing with friends / relatives / guys joining my set when I had mistakenly assumed the girl was by herself. I had to make every approach count and couldn‚Äôt afford to warm up. When I was in rhythm, I averaged a 7-10  min interaction + number close a day from 2-3 approaches. Pretty efficient I‚Äôd say.

Some girls asked me for my biodata. This is similar to a resume, commonly used when shopping around for brides on matrimonial sites. I later learned that the kinds of girls who ask for this are referred to as ‚Äúghats‚Äù ‚Äî traditional girls who usually come from more rural parts of India and / or haven‚Äôt been exposed to Western values much. Their aim in life is to get married, bear children, run the household, and serve their husband. For a long time, I was fixated on the idea of seducing a ghat, whom I considered to be the most forbidden fruit of India. I also found them very attractive in their traditional Indian attire and natural virginal beauty. But my attempts largely failed; I think I was too much of an outsider for them to feel comfortable around me. I‚Äôm convinced they fuck the shit out of alpha guys in their community though. I know this because my rich friend told me that his driver bangs these kind of girls in his village routinely. After a while, I could tell if a girl was a ghat based on their walk and dress. I‚Äôd occasionally try my luck on a ghat but mostly settled for more modern, Westernized girls. 

I found it easier to collect numbers in India compared to USA. Girls also more readily responded to texts and engaged in some back and forth, even if they ultimately didn‚Äôt come out. One day, my friend and I were buying a falafel in Bangalore and we noticed the guy multitasking on his laptop. We saw that he was responding to ~dozen girls on Facebook chat. I was astonished. We asked him whether he‚Äôd met any of them in real life and he said no. Getting girls out for a date was much harder in India compared to USA. In USA, if the interaction is solid and the girl engages via text, a date is usually a given. Not the case in India. A good interaction just got my foot in the door. I had to then partake in a flirtatious texting dance. And even after that, a date was too high an ask. When I started to improve on this, the pandemic hit and I lost my momentum. But my texting wit improved considerably. And in general, I found that texting played a much more important role in India, especially for establishing normalcy and comfort before a girl decided to meet in person. Since I don‚Äôt use any social media, texting was even more important. 

This led me to a broader realization. In NYC, I‚Äôm probably competing against other guys, so I have to throw in a bit more spikes, teases, and try to stand out more in general. This mentality worked against me in India. In India, most guys are cucks. I was basically competing against Netflix. A direct approach during the day was already a big spike in India. I saw things improve when I started to dial down teasing and pushing and replaced it with more comfort building. 

## Notable Experiences
I went on an i-date with a ghat girl in Bangalore who didn't speak English. Using Google Translate, I asked her what she does in her free time. She told me she watches porn. I first thought I misunderstood what she was saying. She then pulled out her phone and showed me Indian porn to make me understand. I thought I got lucky and that she'd be DTF after this, but I was wrong. Didn't see her again.

I approached another ghat in a mall in Hyderabad. I quickly number closed her because her friend was going to join soon. The next morning, I checked my phone and saw several texts and missed calls from her. I called her back around noon. She said she was freaking out because she‚Äôs never given a number to a stranger like that before and thought I‚Äôd hacked her phone. I spent 40 minutes on the phone calming her fears and telling her more about myself and learning more about her. Like a typical ghat, she was going to get arranged marriage after graduating from college. She was leaving Hyderabad in a couple days, so I tried to setup a date that very day. She said she‚Äôll think about it. Didn‚Äôt happen.

I street approached a 23 y-old white French girl in Bangalore. We had a lovely first date at a bar. After some venue shifts, I attempted to kiss her, but she shied away. She initiated the second date, which made me very hopeful. We went on a bicycle ride around Cubbon Park, and I got her back to my apartment and bedroom. We made out and felt each other up, but she didn't didn‚Äôt let me do anything further. I tried to set up a third date, but she declined.

I approached a pretty Indian girl in one of the posh malls in Hyderabad. She was wearing a mask, but had a lovely figure. Solid set and good texting. She offered to give me a tour of Hyderabad and even picked me up in her car. Very unusual for a well educated Indian girl ‚Äî PhD in Anthropology ‚Äî to do this for a guy she just met. We drove around a bit and got a drink. Both of us were living with family so we couldn‚Äôt go to our apartments. I was apartment hunting at the time, so I suggested she come and see the place I'm considering and give her opinion. We bought a couple beers from the liquor shop, hid it in my backpack, and went to the building. A couple kids recognized me and gave me the keys to the room so we could inspect it. We scurried past the landlady's front door so she wouldn't see us or she surely would‚Äôve cockblocked me. We climbed a rickety ladder to the roof of the building. Completely alone with a great view of the city and stars above, we popped open the beers and made out passionately. Meanwhile, the nearby mosque‚Äôs loudspeakers announced it was time for evening prayers which just added to the forbidden thrill. Convinced I‚Äôd see this girl again, I didn‚Äôt push for sex on the roof or in the empty apartment. She ghosted me when I invited her out for a second date.

I approached a girl sporting an AC/DC t-shirt in another Hyderabad mall. Couldn‚Äôt see her face ‚Äî fucking masks ‚Äî but good banter and we exchanged numbers. WhatsApp DP confirmed a nice face. Due to her traveling, we met after a couple weeks. I kept up with strong text game until then and she was investing heavily. I was feeling optimistic. Unbeknownst to me, the day I picked to meet was a dry day across all of Hyderabad due to election voting. All bars and liquor shops were closed. How could I be such an idiot I don‚Äôt know. After hunting around in vain, we ended up at a Starbucks. She had very strong frame and I learned that she‚Äôs bipolar, loves alcohol, been to rehab in the USA multiple times, and is the daughter of some big Indian business tycoon. We couldn‚Äôt really find common ground. I also think I tried too hard to beat her frame which exhausted me. Didn‚Äôt text her after.

I met a young doctor in a Hyderabad mall who was unusually receptive. Instantly hooked. Texting was easy and we grabbed drinks a few days later. It was clear to me after an hour that she was looking for a safe dependable provider guy to marry. She quickly realized I wasn‚Äôt that guy and after that deflected all my romantic advances. She had no issues getting wine and dined on my tab though. It was a big waste of an evening and quite an expensive date by Indian standards.

My friend and I were walking on the beach in South Goa around dinner time. It was dark by then so we could barely see anyone clearly, but we noticed two young looking girls with lovely legs scurry past. Two second rule ‚Äî I approached asking them if they knew any good places nearby to do hookah. My friend quickly joined in. They said they were going to meet their parents at a restaurant and that restaurant had good hookah. I asked them to take us there and we walked side by side for about 10 minutes. The separation was natural and my friend and his girl walked behind me and my girl. Turns out they were sisters, college students on holiday from France, in Goa with their parents. My girl was the captain of her college rugby team. We exchanged numbers and split up at the restaurant. My friend and I smoked hookah at our table facing the vast ocean ahead. The girls and their parents were having dinner at a table a few feet away. Later that night, I texted my girl to see if they wanted to join us for drinks. She said her sister was asleep. I lied and told her my friend is also a sleep so it would be just the two of us. It was around midnight. She said she has an early flight the next day so she needs to sleep. I convinced her that sleep is pointless and we can just get a coffee. She agreed to meet on the beach. I roamed around on the beach for an hour and didn‚Äôt see her. She also stopped responding to my texts. The following morning she texted saying sorry she fell asleep.

Celebrated 2020 New Years at a EDM rave in Goa. Night game, alcohol, and drugs is not my scene, so I decided to dance my heart out and not worry about getting laid. The music was good and then deteriorated. I was dancing harder than everyone around me. I noticed other girls gravitate near me. I started chatting up the ones who were dancing alone. First was a local Goan girl who was friends with the DJ. Second was a white Israeli girl. This went much better and she introduced me to her friend group. All very cool people. I spent the rest of the night drinking and dancing with that group and occasionally had one-on-one convo with the Israeli chick. My friend was busy getting high on ecstasy. Israeli girl offered me drugs, but I refused. Later in the night, I asked her if she wanted to leave and checkout the beach. She knew what I was getting at but declined my offer. I didn‚Äôt let it bother me and still enjoyed the company of everyone in her group and danced my heart out. They invited me out to drink on the beach after the event was over. I took their numbers but passed out after getting back. 

In North Goa, my friend and I crashed in a coworking office space because there were no rooms available until the next day. The following morning, while I was having breakfast with my friend at the same space, three girls joined us. They lived and worked there too, but they had rooms. They‚Äôd seen our sleeping bags, pillows, and disheveled look. I vibed with one of the girls, and I could tell she was into it. I could tell she was the adventurous type because of the tattoos on her arm. But I was leaving that day to go further north to a beach called Arambol. I was very excited about Arambol because I‚Äôd heard there were many foreign chicks there, especially Russians. In my excitement to leave, I didn‚Äôt pursue this girl. In hindsight, I regret that.
